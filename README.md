# Home-Safe
A Java program mimicking a flight company system to apply Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The the project consists of an interface class and 5 other classes including the main class. Users will be prompted to choose from three menus: "Staff/Employees menu", "Passengers menu", and "Flights menu". Here are the details of the services provided:
#### Staff Menu:
- Add an employee
- Print Employee's Information
- Back To The Main Screen

#### Passengers Menu:
- Reserve a flight
- Print a passenger's info
- Calculate cost of passenger's flights
- Back to main screen

#### Flights Menu:
- Add a Flight
- Print a Flight's info
- Find a passenger's flight
- Back to main menu

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Applied:
Inheritance: Used to create a class hierarchy for employees and passengers.
Polymorphism: Implemented to allow different classes to be treated as instances of the same superclass.
Encapsulation: Applied by using private fields and public getter/setter methods.
Abstraction: Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces to define common methods.
Interfaces: Used to define a set of methods that must be implemented by classes.
Exception Handling: Implemented using try-catch blocks to manage errors and exceptions gracefully.
Class Relationships: Established associations, aggregations, and compositions between classes.
Method Overriding: Utilized to provide specific implementations in subclass methods.
Method Overloading: Implemented to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

## Technologies Used:
1. Java: The programming language used for developing the application.
2. NetBeans: The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for writing, debugging, and managing the project.
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Applied OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Usage Instructions:
1. Create a project in your IDE and add all the classes files.
2. Download the sample text file named "employeesInfo" containing emplyees information, copy its path, and paste it in the emplyeesFile variable in the first block in the main class.
3. Follow the prompts in the terminal.
